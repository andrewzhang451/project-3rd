            <p>
                Taking a Software development class in my senior year of highschool really paved 
                a path for my future interest in computer science. During my time in that class,
                we went over various different syntaxes and methods which allowed code objects 
                to repeat over and over again called the for loop. In my head I visualized 
                various different applications which I can utilize this method such as creating
                a coin flip application which utilizes the import of random statements. 
                This class really got me excited as I could see endless possibilities that 
                technology can offer to us. My mind repeatedly asked “how does this work??” or 
                “why does it do that? How can I make an alternative for that iteration?”... I 
                hunger for answers. Even when the pandemic hits, I applied for khan academy and
                self taught most of the class materials so that I can follow along.

            <p>
                During my time in Depaul, I applied for the accelerated python computer science 
                class and received an open spot for it. Within the syllabus, it warned that novice 
                coders should not take this class for now, but I know that I can persevere through 
                it. In the beginning, whether the professor introduced the fundamentals of  different 
                code methods, I was able to follow along since I learned a bit of Swift IOS coding 
                from highschool. Knowing that a school lecture alone is not sufficient and the speed 
                of the lecture was extremely fast especially for a beginner like me, I opt for 
                different solutions such as udemy which offers online courses on python.  
                From my past experience, I learned that computer science is mostly self taught, and 
                the professors can only guide you, not hold your hand all the way. I had a really 
                great time in that class which might be why I do not find the class extremely 
                challenging even though it was accelerated.

            <p>
                From a societal perspective, the world around us is constantly improving, 
                especially from a technological standpoint. From the busy streets of downtown 
                to the peaceful neighborhood in the suburbs, different jobs are replaced by 
                technology. Take mcdonalds for example, there are now machines which you can 
                give your orders to and they will automatically order the food for you. Even 
                surgeons now rely on technology during dangerous operations. With a degree in 
                computer science, I would pursue a career as an software engineer because of 
                the growing technological innovation that is prevalent in the society today. With 
                this degree as a starting line I want to find alternatives for today's problems 
                that people must face, ideas for the future, and inspiration for many of the 
                younger generations.
