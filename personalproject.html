            <p> I have wanted to learn architecture because I want to create something cool 
                so many people will find it to look cool. Designing and creating a building 
                would be my way of showing how I feel about what a great looking modern day 
                building would look like. </p>

            <h2 class="p-Section-Header">The Process</h2>
            <p> To achieve my goal, I would spend at least one hour each day working on the 
                project over the summer. With an hour each day, I will be able to complete 
                this project in only a month. I hope to learn how difficult It will be to 
                design a building that will satisfy not only me, but other people too. I will 
                hope to gain some knowledge through this by understanding generally which type
                of design majority of the people would like. I will be searching up websites 
                on how to design a beautiful building and buy, borrow books of tips on designing 
                a stable and stylish modern house. I know I have reached my goal when I am able 
                to produce a design that would satisfy the people that I will show the designs to. 
                I would also know when I have reached my goal when I am able to easily produce a 
                design without much effort. I will create a 3D model and a blueprint to go with 
                it for this project. Over this summer vacation, I will start with designing the 
                building, mixing all the different designs I have created in my past years in 
                elementary school. </p>

            <p>I decided on making a blueprint of a house and a model of the house that I 
                have designed. I picked a few questions to ask about what type of house a 
                few of the people I have chose to survey would prefere. I went to gather 
                supplies and started my design on the blueprint. I researched some ideas on 
                google and found a few pretty good ones. While researching, I have learned 
                some new ideas and was even more inspired by other professionals work of 
                art. I manage my time and resources effectively by tracking how much time 
                I had to do my product and journals and see if did them on time. The 
                obstacles for this project was the fact that I had to find all the required 
                materials and time management. I handle these obstacles by asking others for 
                help on where and how to acquire my needed materials and finish homework and 
                study early so that I can have time to work on my personal project. The 
                self-management I have developed throughout the project was that I have 
                learned to always plan out what I want to do and schedule my activities. 
                I have found out how useful this technique really turned out to be, now I 
                daily use this technique even when I am at home doing homework. This 
                self-management technique I have came up with myself help me out with my 
                daily school life a lot, where It benefits me time and frustration-wise. 
                My peers who have trouble with time-management should also use this technique, 
                since this will keep them organized and force them to have a schedule that 
                they have come up with themselves.</p>
